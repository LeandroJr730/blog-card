### Links

- Live Site URL: [leandrojr730.github.io](https://leandrojr730.github.io)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I reviewed and used basic html and css properties, including flex box.
I "learned" how to make this website works in mobile devices.
Below is the code that makes my site work in mobile devices, I know that this is definitely no the best coding but I'm proud of it because I made it myself, just searching the basics on the internet.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 375px) {
  .box {
    width: 70%;
    height: 65%;
  }
  summary,
  aside,
  article a,
  section,
  .box footer {
    font-size: 90%;
  }
  figure img {
    width: 115%;
    object-fit: none;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I need to learn more about how to set up sites to work on mobile devices and I also need to code faster. I waste a lot of time trying to get the perfect margin, padding... when there is no need to be that good.
